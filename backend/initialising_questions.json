    "Let's begin the interview with a fundamental question: What do you understand by machine learning and are there any types of that?",
    "Can you explain the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with examples?",
    "What is the main difference between classification and regression problems in machine learning?",
    "How would you explain overfitting and underfitting to someone who is new to machine learning?",
    "What is the purpose of splitting data into training, validation, and test sets?",
    "Can you describe what cross-validation is and why it's important in machine learning?",
    "What do you understand by the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning models?",
    "How would you approach a machine learning problem if you were given a new dataset?",
    "What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric machine learning algorithms?",
    "Can you explain what feature engineering is and why it's important in the machine learning pipeline?",
    "What are some common evaluation metrics for classification problems and when would you use each?",
    "How do you handle missing data in a dataset and what are the different imputation techniques?",
    "What is gradient descent and how does it work in training machine learning models?",
    "Can you explain the concept of regularization and why it's used in machine learning?",
    "What is the difference between bagging and boosting ensemble methods?",
    "How would you detect and handle outliers in your dataset?",
    "What is the curse of dimensionality and how can it affect machine learning models?",
    "Can you explain what a confusion matrix is and how to interpret it?",
    "What are some techniques for feature selection and when would you use them?",
    "How do you choose the right algorithm for a given machine learning problem?"
